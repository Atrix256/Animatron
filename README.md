The software I use to make "simplexplanations" videos.

After cloning the repo, you must init & update submodules to get df_serialize.

```git submodule init```

```git submodule update```

From there you can build and run the code and start making videos.

You do need latex installed to be able to render text. I suggest MikTex! https://miktex.org/

You also need to tell it where the latex binaries are by editing the "latexbinaries" value in "internal/config.json"

Here is a video tutorial on how to use the editor.
